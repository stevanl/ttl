%h1 The Challenge
%p In an increasingly competitive workplace, getting a “start” often proves the greatest challenge. There are numerous factors which prevent people from embarking on prosperous careers. Primary reasons for this are lack of direction, insufficient funding and inadequate access to proper resources.

%h2 Meeting the Challenge – A Turnkey Solution
%p TrainE-TraidE is a charity assisting people in becoming financially independent, either through helping them build businesses or secure employment. By working collaboratively, we create opportunities for everyone, at any life stage and in any situation. TrainE-TraidE has become the community’s leading employment and business hub providing a range of training opportunities leading to qualifications, in order for people to gain or enhance their employment. There are currently over 200 students enrolled on courses. We also offer career guidance and a job readiness service which is accessed by over 1000 individuals annually. TrainE-TraidE, working collaboratively with its wide network of business contacts is able to secure jobs for those looking for employment through its permanent placement scheme. 
%p In the current economic climate jobs are scarce. Recruitment statistics show that it is essential for jobseekers to have some relevant experience even before being considered for interview. It is a vicious cycle facing many candidates – with no relevant experience there is no chance of a job and with no job there is no chance of gaining experience. In order to address this issue, TrainE-TraidE has developed an innovative placement scheme, working with companies, to secure placements for job seekers. The results have been exceptional and 26% of the unpaid placements have led to full time employment and training contracts.
%p As part of the full turnkey solution, TrainE-TraidE assists with the establishment and development of new and existing businesses in order to generate sustainable long term incomes for budding business men and women. Services include; initial business assessments, mentoring, permanent or hot desk access, advice sessions, business training seminars including a mini MBA from Birkbeck, University of London, business surgeries and access to finance.  We have assisted over 150 businesses through one or more of these services.

%h2 Funding
%p In today’s highly professional and competitive business marketplace, it is essential that all training and business support be at a level that is on par with the demands of the “real world”.
%p As an integral part of TrainE-TraidE’s remit, it will do the utmost not to turn away candidates who, due to limited financial resources, cannot embark on a particular course of study. TrainE-TraidE offers scholarships to those students who cannot afford to pay for their studies. We will not offer any single candidate 100% scholarship, as it is important, however difficult, for the candidate to make their own contribution to show serious commitment.
%p TrainE-TraidE requires core funding, to ensure that all equipment and premises are state of the art, and that the people working to help the businesses and individuals are properly qualified. TrainE-TraidE employs seven highly qualified professionals.
%p By supporting the TrainE-TraidE Business Awards Lunch, you are publicly aligning yourself with those seeking employment or assistance in developing their businesses, thus helping them on their way to financial self sufficiency.
%p The money raised at the Business Awards Lunch will allow TrainE-TraidE to continue its vital work for the Jewish Community. This will in turn enable individuals to become self sufficient by earning a sustainable income.
%p The TrainE-TraidE Business Awards Lunch attracts an audience of high profile business individuals. Those attending will include major donors, key leaders and opinion formers in the Jewish community.
%p The TrainE-TraidE Business Awards Lunch is the perfect opportunity for you to entertain existing clients and network with prospective clients whilst being exposed to current business thinking, within a professional atmosphere.
